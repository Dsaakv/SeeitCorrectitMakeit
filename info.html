<h2>UAT PRESIDENT’S LETTER</h2>
<br>
<p1>Welcome to UAT!

    Each day as I walk through the doors of UAT, I feel the energy of our community of bright, driven students and our dedicated faculty and staff. I am continually renewed by the distinct feeling of connection on campus.

    We are grateful to our faculty who continually encourage students’ growth through one-on-one mentorship and the bright minds who push themselves to think creatively, test their limits and direct their passion for tech toward innovation. UAT is truly an environment of learning that’s a rare beauty—a college experience not found elsewhere.

    We expect our students to outpace the learning and growth of University to propel UAT forward. This growth in advancing technology and higher education has been a multigenerational journey. As state and local colleges are just now climbing the mountain we climbed 20 years ago, we’re on to the next mountain—one that no one knows about yet. Just imagine.

    We invite you to visit our campus, speak with our students and professors and discover the meaning behind our passion for leadership, friendliness, teamwork and having fun. We will always strive to do honorable work and own it without apology and unafraid of judgement. Join us and experience the UAT difference—our values are a way of life and the connective tissue among academia, industry and the technology leaders of tomorrow.

    Sincerely,

    Jason Pistillo, President</p1>
